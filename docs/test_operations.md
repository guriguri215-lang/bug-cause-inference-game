# Test Operations

Status: operational guidance for local verification and CI. This document does not change runtime behavior, test scope, metrics, policies, action costs, datasets, or report semantics.

## Scope

Use this note to keep evaluation and test runs consistent across local development, Codex sessions, and CI.

This note does not:

- skip, xfail, or narrow CLI/file-output tests that use `tmp_path`;
- hardcode user-specific temporary directories;
- weaken GitHub Actions verification;
- change P1b or P1c runtime behavior, metrics, policies, thresholds, scores, datasets, real-diff artifacts, or observation semantics.

## Verification Tiers

Full repository verification:

```bash
python -B -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

Targeted P1b/P1c CLI and real-diff checks:

```bash
python -B -m pytest tests/test_cli.py tests/test_p1b_cli.py tests/test_p1c_cli.py tests/test_p1b_real_diff.py -q -p no:cacheprovider
python -m bug_cause_inference.p1b.real_diff --validate
```

Targeted P1c report checks:

```bash
python -B -m pytest tests/test_p1c_labels.py tests/test_p1c_evaluation.py tests/test_p1c_cli.py -q -p no:cacheprovider
python -m bug_cause_inference.cli p1c-evaluate --format json
python -m bug_cause_inference.cli p1c-evaluate --format markdown
```

Representative smoke checks for generated outputs:

```bash
python -m bug_cause_inference.cli p1b-evaluate --observation-mode both --format markdown
python -m bug_cause_inference.cli p1c-evaluate --observation-mode execution_grounded --format markdown
python -m bug_cause_inference.cli p1c-evaluate --observation-mode both --policies expected_utility_per_cost --format json
```

## CI Expectations

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is expected to run on Ubuntu with Python 3.10, install `requirements.txt` plus the editable package, run the full pytest suite, and validate P1b real-diff artifacts.

CI should keep the full pytest command and real-diff validator unless there is a clear repository-side problem. Do not reduce CI coverage just to avoid local sandbox issues or speed up verification.

## `tmp_path` Tests

CLI/file-output tests and P1b real-diff generation tests use pytest's `tmp_path` fixture intentionally. These tests verify that output paths, nested parent creation, generated checkout trees, and validation work roots behave correctly without writing into committed example or artifact directories.

Do not replace these tests with fixed repository paths, skips, or xfails to work around local temporary-directory permission failures.

## Codex Sandbox Temp Constraint

Some Codex sandbox runs on Windows have failed while pytest was creating or cleaning the user temp root, for example:

```text
PermissionError: C:\Users\gurig\AppData\Local\Temp\pytest-of-gurig
```

Treat this as a local execution-environment constraint when the same pytest command passes with normal permissions.

Operational rule:

- Do not change production code, pytest configuration, CI, or `tmp_path` tests to work around the sandbox Temp permission failure.
- Rerun the same pytest command with normal permissions or explicit approval.
- Record both the sandbox failure and the normal-permission rerun result.
- If the same command fails with normal permissions, treat it as a repository or test failure and investigate normally.
